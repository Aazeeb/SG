Simple Linear Regression - There is one input column which is used to predict the output
Multi Linear Regression - Multiple independent variables(multiple input columns)

Criteria for applying linear regression:
The input and output should have almost a linear relationship

Metrics:
Regression
-Mean Absolute Error
-Mean Squared Error
-Root Mean Squared Error
-R2 Score
-Adjusted R2 Score

We use the errors to Optimize the model 

A few models use Differentiation in optimation techniques
hence MAE is not very effective
so, the need for newer metric, hence MSE

RMSE for better readability
---------------------------------------------

Bias
Variance
Overfitting
Underfitting
Regularization
-L1 Regularization
-L2 Regularization
Bagging
Boosting
---------------------------
overfitting - the model is accurately following the training data, but not having desired results on testing data.
underfitting- the model does not learn the training properly and hence will nonot be able to predict the testing data properly as well.

Bias- Inability of the model to learn from training data
variance-Difference of errors on various types of data

An ideal ML model should have:
Low Bias
Low Variance

Bias-Variance tradeoff
-Regularization
-Bagging
-Boosting
----------------------

L2 Regularization
Ridge Regression
E= sum(y-y_pred)^2 + lambda.m2  , where m=slope, lamba=hyperparameter


range of lambda is 0 to infinity

GridSearchCV - tune the hyperparamter

m =  ("∑(x−" 𝑥′")(y−" 𝑦′") " )/(("∑(x−" 𝑥′")" 2) +lambda)


L1 Regularization
Lasso Regression
lambda.|m|

-------------------------------------

Feature Engineering
-Removing unneccesary features
-Select best features
-Feature Extraction: We create new features from the existing features

Imputing missing values:
a few rules we will assume
if the percentage of missing values is between 0 and 20, fill it with mean, median or mode
if the percentage of missing values is above 60%, remove the column because there is lots of missing data
if the percentage of missing values is between 20 and 60, look for advance imputing techniques like: knn imputer,etc.
-----------------------
split the data into training and testing
some part of data into training
training data will be fed to the machine
after machine is trained, we will validate it using the testing data

Encoding - to convert values from object datatype to numerical datatype
Input
Output

For output value being non-numeric, we use Label Encoder
For input value being non-numeric, there could be two types of data
1. Ordinal
2. Nominal
For ordinal values, we use ordinal encoding, which will give each category the numerical predence based on the value it deserves
For nominal values, we use one hot encoding

Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Clustering : Kmeans
Decision Trees
SVM - Support Vector machines
Association
--------------------------------------
KMeans
K- no of clusters

k is determined by a few factors listed below
- k should never be 1
- k ideally should not exceed the square root of total number of points
- k value could be found by using a statistical technique called as elbow method
-Elbow method is a grpahical representation, where in we plot
SSE on y-axis and no. of clusters on x-axis.
Wherever the graph makes an elbow like point, that is taken as the value of k

Logistic Regression

Requirement:
We should be able to linear separate the data by drawing a straight line(2D), plane(3D), hyperplane(higher dimension)
if the above condition is satisfied, we can use logistic regression to classify the data
We find the equation of line
AX+By+C=0		(2D)
Ax+By+Cz+D=0	(3D)

we should be able to find A, B and C.

taking the example
cgpa	iq	placement
7.5	61	1
8.9	109	1
7	81	0

x=cgpa, y=iq
s1=A(7.5)+B(61)=?
if s1>=0, then student will be placed
if s1<0, then student will not be placed

but, there the values could range from -infinity to infinity

this value will be passed tthrough a sigmoid function
Sigmoid function will converts the value in the range to 0 to 1.

s(x)=1/(1+(e^-x))

100

0 and 1
s(x)>0.5, then prediction is +ve
if s(x)<0.5, then prediction is -ve

Standardization -1 to 1
Normalization 0 to 1
